 	<h1>Hello, I'm Lou-Anne</h1>
  		<img src="images/profile-picture.png" class="img-circle" width="150px" alt="Lou-Anne Devulder">
  		<p>I’ve been riding a horse since I was 2 years old, riding is my passion but I don’t intend to make a career out of it, I’d rather work in digital marketing or events, and that’s why I’m in the second year of business school at IESEG</p>

 	<h2>My studies</h2>
  		<p>I choose to enter at IESEG because this school is reputed, covers many topics during the school years which enable us to find our way after discovering all the possible ones, moreover she has a large network to provide us good internships or jobs after being graduate.  </p>

 <div class="card-white"> 
 	<h2>My dream jobs</h2>
  		<p>As I mention earlier, I would like to work in digital marketing, and more precisely in the digital communication part because I really like creating design and make them respond to a certain attempt or a certain target.
  		And my dream job since some years now would be to work in an events agence as a manager in order to organise the events from the beginning to the end.</p>

 	<h2>My passion: horse riding</h2>
  		<p>As I mention earlier too, I ride since a very long time, 17 years to be correct, without interruptions. And thanks to my parents, I have the chance since one year to have my own horse, whose name is Finger, and who makes me grow up because of failures and of course bring me a lot of happiness.</p>
